## Problem

### Coding problem - 1

Listen

In a contest where $N$  **new**  users visited the contest,

- $A$ users just saw the problems and didn’t make any submissions and hence won’t get any rating.
- $B$ users who made a submission but could not solve any problem correctly. Thus, after the contest, they will get a rating in the range $800 - 1000$.
- Everyone else could correctly solve at least $1$ problem. Thus, they will get a rating strictly greater than $1000$ after the contest.

You need to output the number of new users in the contest who, after the contest, will get a rating and also the number of new users who will get a rating  **strictly greater**  than $1000$.

The code given in the IDE uses the concept of  **functions**.
Update the code to solve the problem.

### Input Format
- Each input file contains of a single line, with three integers $N, A$ and $B$ - the number of new users, the number of users who just saw the problem and didn't make any submission, and the number of users who made a submission but could not solve any problem correctly.
### Output Format

Output two integers separated by a space in a single line - the number of new users who will get a rating at the end of the contest and the number of new users who will get a rating higher than $1000$.

### Constraints
- $2 \leq N \leq 1000$
- $1 \leq A \leq 1000$
- $1 \leq B \leq 1000$
- $A + B \leq N$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
10 3 2

```

```
7 5

```

### Explanation:

There were $10$ new users. Among those $10$, $3$ didn't make any submissions. This means that the other $10 - 3 = 7$ users made submissions and will get a rating. This is the first integer of the output.

Now, among these $7$ users, $2$ couldn't solve any problem even though they submitted and tried. So, they will get a rating less than equal to $1000$. The other $7 - 2 = 5$ users were able to solve at least $1$ problem and hence will get a rating greater than $1000$. Hence, the second integer of the output is $5$.

### Sample 2:
Input
Output

```
10 4 1

```

```
6 5

```

### Explanation:

There were $10$ new users. Among those $10$, $4$ didn't make any submissions. This means that the other $10 - 4 = 6$ users made submissions and will get a rating. This is the first integer of the output.

Now, among these $6$ users, $1$ couldn't solve any problem even though they submitted and tried. So, they will get a rating less than equal to $1000$. The other $6 - 1 = 5$ users were able to solve at least $1$ problem and hence will get a rating greater than $1000$. Hence, the second integer of the output is $5$.

### Sample 3:
Input
Output

```
20 1 2

```

```
19 17

```

### Explanation:

There were $20$ new users. Among those $20$, $1$ didn't make any submissions. This means that the other $20 - 1 = 19$ users made submissions and will get a rating. This is the first integer of the output.

Now, among these $19$ users, $2$ couldn't solve any problem even though they submitted and tried. So, they will get a rating less than equal to $1000$. The other $19 - 2 = 17$ users were able to solve at least $1$ problem and hence will get a rating greater than $1000$. Hence, the second integer of the output is $17$.

### Sample 4:
Input
Output

```
1000 300 700

```

```
700 0

```

### Explanation:

There were $1000$ new users. Among those $1000$, $300$ didn't make any submissions. This means that the other $1000 - 300 = 700$ users made submissions and will get a rating. This is the first integer of the output.

Now, among these $700$ users, $700$ couldn't solve any problem even though they submitted and tried. So, they will get a rating less than equal to $1000$. The other $700 - 700 = 0$ users were able to solve at least $1$ problem and hence will get a rating greater than $1000$. Hence, the second integer of the output is $0$.

## Solution

**Language:** c_cpp  
**Runtime:** N/A  
**Memory:** N/A  
**Submitted:** 2026-08-04T16:46:20.196Z  

```c_cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int total_score(int a, int b, int c) {
    return (c - a);
}

int high_score(int a, int b, int c) {
    return (c - a - b);
}

int main() {
    int N, A, B;
    cin >> N >> A >> B;

    int result_1 = total_score(A, B, N);
    int result_2 = high_score(A, B, N);

    cout << result_1 << " " << result_2 << endl;

    
}

```
