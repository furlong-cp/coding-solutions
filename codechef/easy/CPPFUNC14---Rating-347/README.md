## Problem

### Coding problem-4

Listen

Chef is taking his baby steps into the world of programming.

The very first program he's tasked to write is as follows:
"Given two integers $A$ and $B$, print $A+B$."

Unfortunately, Chef makes a typo: his program outputs $A\times B$ instead of $A+B$.

Given the values of $A$ and $B$, can you help Chef find the  *absolute difference*  between the correct answer and the value his program prints?

#### Code in the IDE to solve the problem.
### Input Format

The only line of input will contain two space-separated integers, $A$ and $B$.

### Output Format

Print a single integer: the difference between the correct answer and Chef's output.

### Constraints

$1 \leq A, B \leq 10$

### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
4 7
```

```
17
```

### Explanation:

The correct answer is $4+7 = 11$, but Chef's program prints $4\times 7 = 28$.
The difference between them is $|28 - 11| = 17$.

### Sample 2:
Input
Output

```
1 6
```

```
1
```

### Explanation:

The correct answer is $1+6 = 7$, but Chef's program prints $1\times 6 = 6$.
The difference between these values is $1$.

```c_cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib> // for std::abs

using namespace std;

int multiple(int a, int b) {
    return a * b;
}

int total(int x, int y) {
    return x + y;
}

int abs_diff(int a, int b) {
    return abs(a - b);
}

int main() {
    int A, B;
    cin >> A >> B;
    
    int C = multiple(A, B);
    int D = total(A, B);
    int E = abs_diff(C, D);
    
    cout << E << endl;
    
    
}
```
