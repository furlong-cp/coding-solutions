## Problem

### How to accept multiple integers on separate lines

Let's make this a little bit more complicated.

You need to write a program which does the following

- Accepts $2$ integers as input in 1st line as the variables $A$, $B$
- Accepts $3$ integers as input in the 2nd line as the variables $C$, $D$ and $E$
- Accepts $4$ integers as input in the 3rd line as the variables $F$, $G$, $H$ and $I$
- Prints out $9$ integers as output in a single line to the console

```c_cpp
// replace the '_' with the correct syntax
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I;
    cin>> A >> B;
    cin >> C >>D>> E;
    cin >>F>>G>> H >> I;
    cout << A << " " << B << " " << C << " " << D << " " << E << " " << F << " " << G << " " << H << " " << I;
    return 0;
}
```
