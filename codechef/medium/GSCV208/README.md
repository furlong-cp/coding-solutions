You need to write a program which does the following

- Accepts $2$ space separated alphanumeric strings as input in $1^{st}$ line as the variables $A$, $B$
- Accepts $3$ space separated alphanumeric strings as input in $2^{nd}$ line as the variables $C$, $D$, $E$
- Accepts $4$ space separated alphanumeric strings as input in $3^{rd}$ line as the variables $F$, $G$, $H$, $I$
- Prints out $9$ space separated strings as output in a single line to the console
### Sample 1:
