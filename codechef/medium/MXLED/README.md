## Problem

### Maximum Lead

Two players play a game consisting of $N$ rounds.

In each round, both players receive some points. After every round, the scores obtained so far are added to form the  **cumulative score**  of each player.

For example, suppose after two rounds the scores are:

- Player $1$: $10, 20$
- Player $2$: $15, 5$

After round $2$, their cumulative scores are $30$ and $20$ respectively. Therefore, Player $1$ is leading by $10$ points.

The player with the higher cumulative score after a round is the leader of that round. The  **lead**  is the difference between the two cumulative scores.

Among all rounds, find the player who achieved the  **maximum lead**  at the end of any round, along with that lead.

It is guaranteed that there will be a unique winner.

### Input Format
- The first line contains an integer $N$ — the number of rounds.
- Each of the next $N$ lines contains two integers $S_i$ and $T_i$ — the scores of Player $1$ and Player $2$ respectively in the $i$-th round.
### Output Format
- Print two space-separated integers $W$ and $L$, where: $W$ is the player who achieved the maximum lead, either $1$ or $2$. $L$ is the maximum lead achieved.
### Constraints
- $1 \le N \le 10^4$
- $1 \le S_i,T_i \le 1000$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
4
10 5
4 8
7 3
6 9
```

```
1 5
```

### Explanation:

The cumulative scores after each round are:

- Round $1$: $10$ and $5$ — Player $1$ leads by $5$.
- Round $2$: $14$ and $13$ — Player $1$ leads by $1$.
- Round $3$: $21$ and $16$ — Player $1$ leads by $5$.
- Round $4$: $27$ and $25$ — Player $1$ leads by $2$.

The maximum lead is $5$, achieved by Player $1$.

### Sample 2:
Input
Output

```
5
3 8
10 4
2 9
7 6
5 10
```

```
2 10
```

### Explanation:

The cumulative scores after each round are:

- Round $1$: $3$ and $8$ — Player $2$ leads by $5$.
- Round $2$: $13$ and $12$ — Player $1$ leads by $1$.
- Round $3$: $15$ and $21$ — Player $2$ leads by $6$.
- Round $4$: $22$ and $27$ — Player $2$ leads by $5$.
- Round $5$: $27$ and $37$ — Player $2$ leads by $10$.

The maximum lead is $10$, achieved by Player $2$.

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
    cin.tie(0);

    int n; // number of rounds
    cin >> n;// input
    int s = 0, t = 0; // both scores initialised to 0
    int maxlead = 0; // maximum lead
    int w = 0; // winner (1 or 2)

    while (n--) {
        int a, b; // scores 
        cin >> a >> b;
        s += a;
        t += b;
        int curr_lead = abs(s - t); // check for abs
        if (curr_lead > maxlead) { // compare and change with every round
            maxlead = curr_lead;
            if (s > t)
                w = 1;
            else
                w= 2;
        }
    }
    cout << w << " " << maxlead;
    return 0;
}
```
