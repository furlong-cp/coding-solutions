## Problem

### Maximum Water Container

You are given an array $height$ of length $n$, where $height[i]$ represents the height of a vertical line drawn at position $i$.

Choose  **two different lines**  at indices $i$ and $j$ such that, together with the $x$-axis, they form a container.

The amount of water stored by the container depends on:

- the distance between the two lines, and
- the height of the shorter line.

Find the  **maximum amount of water**  that can be stored by choosing the best pair of lines.

The container  **cannot be tilted**.

### Input Format

The first line contains an integer $n$ — the number of vertical lines. The second line contains $n$ space-separated integers representing the array $height$.

### Output Format

Print a single integer — the maximum amount of water that can be stored.

### Constraints
- $2 \le n \le 10^5$
- $0 \le height[i] \le 10^4$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
9
1 8 6 2 5 4 8 3 7
```

```
49
```

### Explanation:

Choosing the lines at indices $1$ and $8$ gives:

- Width $=8-1=7$
- Height $=\min(8,7)=7$

Therefore, the amount of water stored is:

$$ 7 \times 7=49 $$
### Sample 2:
Input
Output

```
2
1 1
```

```
1
```

### Explanation:

The two lines are one unit apart, and the shorter height is $1$.

Therefore, the amount of water stored is:

$$ 1 \times 1=1 $$
