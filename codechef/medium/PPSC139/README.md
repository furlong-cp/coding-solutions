```c_cpp
// Solution as follows

#include <stdio.h>

// Function to increment a number using a pointer
void incrementByOne(int *numPtr) {
    (*numPtr)++; // Increment the value pointed to by numPtr
}

int main() {
    int number;
    scanf("%d", &number);

    // Call the increment function and pass the address of 'number'
    incrementByOne(&number);

    printf("%d\n", number);

    return 0;
}

```
